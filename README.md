# RoboFriends Page

This project was created thoroughly with the use of React.js.

It displays a webpage of different profiles that feature names and emails. These profiles use an external API that obtains different name & email pairs, and displays every entry in the list of RoboFriends. Each profile is given a photo of a robot to contrast between each entry of the API, so that two or more entries do not use the same robot photo.

The full webpage can be seen in https://banaas.github.io/test-project.
